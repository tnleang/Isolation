# Isolation

Algorithm is based off of iterative deepening search with alpha-beta pruning for minimax

[Algorithm & Heuristic link](https://github.com/philferriere/aind-projects/blob/master/isolation/game_agent.py), there are many different heuristic. I am not sure which is the best one.

TODO:
* Choose a good heuristic function
* Have a function to return a copy of the board with a move applied.
